Working on MacOS, Linux and OpenBSD. It currently runs in production on the latter, but I expect it to work anywhere you have a modern Perl.

=== Setup for OpenBSD ===

Add this to your pf.conf:

table <flashpolicy> const { self }
rdr pass proto tcp from any to <flashpolicy> \
    port 843 -> \
    127.0.0.1 port 843

This will redirect any Flash policy request to a daemon on 843. You can start the daemon from rc.local, but I prefer to have an angel process. My root crontab includes a line like this:

*   *   *   *   *   nc localhost 843 < /dev/null | grep -q xml || /usr/local/sbin/flashpolicyd
